### _Human Resources Representative (HR)_
The purpose of this role is to create new employee accounts, validate employee leaves, and maintain the platform. After processing an employeeâ€™s data, through the application, the Human Resources team will create an account for that employee. All employee leave requests will then be processed by Human Resources. Also, the Human Resources representatives can use the application just like another employee (they can return to the login page through the back button and can choose the role of user in order to be able to request their leave).

### _Employee_
When an employee logs in they will pe prompted to a gui where they can browse the leave types, see a calendar where they can select the date and select the number of days for the leave. Each employee can request through the application the type of leave desired (eg: rest, for vocational training, unpaid, medical, maternity, paternal, childcare, special events, quarantine) for a certain period of time. The request is submitted to the Human Resources representative, who may or may not accept it.

For a good operation, the application remembers the history of holidays for both employees and those from Human Resources.
